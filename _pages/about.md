Hi I’m Trent Walraven, and I’m a Senior in Cyber Security Engineering at Iowa State University. I’m currently the President of the Information Assurance Student Group at Iowa State. Relating to my major I a also participate in the Cyber Defense Competition held on campus, with a few high placements, and participate in Capture the Flag Competitions. I’m highly interested in physical security alongside the digital aspect of cybersecurity. Beyond security I am a member of the Culinary Science Club, and the Quiz Bowl Club on campus, and have interests in console modding and board games.

After having spent time at John Deere on the embedded red team, and in personal projects. I have to realize that I really want to focus on embedded security as a whole, as embedded devices are built and intended to last a long time, while also receiving the least amount of updates due to their nature of not being the forefront of attention. That makes security in these devices extremely important, and something that is currently lacking. Going into this specialty, I hope to improve the industry as whole, by setting precedent for building secure, updatable, and maintained embedded devices, that remain secure for their useable lifespan.

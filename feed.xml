More specifically what we are hoping to inspect and detail, either vulnerabilities or protections against, is side channel attack like Spectre or Flush+Reload. Side channel attacks are attacks that exploit that inherent state change in a processor from use by multiple people, and steal data about the other people running code without needing to interact directly with the other running code.</p> <p>My role in the project is testing design. This is a rather important role in our project, as we are emulating the cloud environment to not cause harm to the public cloud. So the testing environment that I build needs to replicate the cloud as close as possible if we want to accurately get results.</p> <p>I have gained a ton of knowledge about new coding language Ruby that I will be attempting to write my side channel attacks in, alongside rather large amounts again about how processors, and their cache works to further understand and perform a side channel attack.</p> <p>A link to our <a href="https://sdmay24-26.sd.ece.iastate.edu/">senior design website</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="senior design"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A detailed analysis of serverless functions as a senior design project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cyber Tractor Challenge</title><link href="https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/Cyber-Tractor-Challenge/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cyber Tractor Challenge"/><published>2022-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/Cyber-Tractor-Challenge</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/Cyber-Tractor-Challenge/"><![CDATA[<p>Official John Deere Cyber Tractor Challenge Promo video: <a href="https://www.deere.com/en/stories/featured/top-tech-students-attempt-to-hack-deere-machines/">John Deere Newsletter</a></p> <p>Over the latter half of last week I got the chance to participate in the Cyber Tractor Challenge put on by John Deere. This event brought in students from around the country to have hands on time with John Deere equipment. During the event, there were professionals in the Cyber Security field brought in to teach classes about different technologies that was utilized by John Deere equipment. While I missed most of these lectures when they were happening, I did get to look at the materials, and do the labs after the fact. These classes, gave me insight and knowledge of how these technologies are used in an embedded system. After the classes we got to be hands on with equipment pulled straight from working John Deere equipment. I would have never gotten the chance to work with any of the equipment we were given if I was working on my own. Purchasing the needed equipment would have been prohibitively expensive, this to me was a chance to interact in no-stakes basis where if I managed to brick anything, the worst that would happen, was the time needed to bring something back to factory settings. While this freedom to experiment on hardware was a big part of the event, to me, it was not the most important thing I got from the event.</p> <p>During the event I got the chance to talk to, and work with members of professional red teams, this was a great opportunity to help me learn and refine my mental processes when going about black box testing of anything. With their help, I was able to realize I often got the cart ahead of the horse, where I was not thinking about the current smaller problem in the way, but rather looking at the big picture and treating as a single obstacle that needed overcoming. With my mentor’s help, I learned that I needed to take a little more time, do a little more planning, and create a list of short list of steps that I want to solve in order to get my end goal. A perfect example that I can think of when looking back is when I was playing with a router I got. I had gotten access to a shell on the system from an exposed UART header, and my mind immediately jumped to how I could get my own code running directly on the router whenever it booted. It seemed like one step at the time, and you just had to do it. Thinking about it now, a good plan would have been to break it into a few steps in this order, establishing write capabilities to the disk, load a new file from an external source, get some very basic code running, get that code running at startup, then develop the payload that I would want to run at boot. This breaking into steps would have made the challenge less daunting, and more doable. While the hardware was interesting it will change as time moves forward, this refining of my mental model will continue to help me throughout the rest of my career.</p> <p>Another benefit of having many students and professionals from around the country is networking. This event helped me network with other like-minded individuals, who I can bounce ideas off of and ask questions to in the future. Along with potentially opening more doors for me as I move from a college student, to a full-time professional. Participating in the event also got me my second challenge coin (pictured below) which is something minor, but something I thought was really fun to get.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/JohnDeere/challengeCoin.png" alt="Image of gold and green coin with &quot;2022 John Deere Cyber Tractor Challenge&quot; along the circumference of the coin, and a large tractor with circuit themed background in the center of the coin"/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="internship"/><category term="hacking"/><category term="hackathon"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My experience with the John Deere event that brought in students from around the country to test the security of John Deere equipment]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">John Deere Internship at 6 Weeks</title><link href="https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/JohnDeere6Weeks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="John Deere Internship at 6 Weeks"/><published>2022-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/JohnDeere6Weeks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/JohnDeere6Weeks/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="lets-start-off-at-the-beginning">Let’s start off at the beginning</h2> <p>At the end of May, I started a new internship on the Cloud Security Team at John Deere. Since I am just over halfway through the internship, I thought I would write about how the internship is going.</p> <p>This being my first internship, I was not sure what to expect going in, or what I was going to get out of it. From the minute I got my laptop that first day, I feel like I have been learning so much. At times it has been rather overwhelming, but everyday I’m feeling a little better about what is going on. Starting out that first week, I did a large amount of HR related teachings, and then moved onto training on Agile development.</p> <h3 id="time-for-some-real-training">Time for some real training</h3> <p>Prior to this, I had never heard of, or experienced Agile development before. At first, it seemed like a lot of meetings, and instead of increasing the team’s productivity, it would lower it. After a few weeks of all the meetings, I started to really like Agile Development. In Agile Development, your goal is to deliver a small piece of a project in a short time period, instead of delivering a whole project all at once. This breaking up of a large project into smaller chunks was very helpful with my understanding of the projects, and where in development they were. This also let me jump into the portions of the project that I knew how to help in, while listening and learning in the parts that I did not know. In the process, I also made an obsidian notebook that can be found <a href="/agile-development-notebook">here</a> if you want to see how I thought through it.</p> <p>After that first week with HR and Agile trainings, I started to get into the team specific training. Coming into the team, I did not have very much knowledge in cloud concepts or AWS. Thankfully, John Deere understands this, and offers subscriptions to <a href="https://acloudguru.com">ACloudGuru</a> for all staff and reimbursements for any certificates earned. The first suggested certificate is the AWS Cloud Practitioner. I spent the next couple of weeks going through all the training videos and the labs for the course to prepare me for the Cloud Practitioner Exam. As I was going through this course, it was overwhelming with the number of services that AWS offered, but I felt like I was slowly getting the hang of it. This culminated in taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam and passing!</p> <h3 id="actual-work-i-have-done">Actual Work I have done</h3> <p>This led into actually getting some work done on my internship. The biggest and most memorable thing that I have done so far is working a project that involves EC2 port control. Being a member of the Cloud Security Team we are in control of what is and is not allowed on policies in John Deere’s section of AWS. Currently EC2 instances public ports are required to be reviewed by a person before they are approved. With the only enforcement being an automated check that happens every so often, where the team gets a ticket to fix the issue. This means a person could change their instance to allow something like SSH when they are not approved for it and the only consequence is some nasty email until it is fixed. The goal of the project is to automate large portions of this procedure to approve ports, keep record of the approved ports, and add additional enforcement to prevent a user from doing something not allowed. Users will be able to request ports by modifying files on a file share, these changes will get processed to decide if they can be automatically approved, or not. Then they will then get sent through to a database to house what the approved ports for each security group are. The database is the part that I have worked on most. I was tasked with creating a DynamoDB that is going to be used as a cache that stores the currently authorized ports without having to make a call to pull a whole file from the file server every call. I have also had to create a lambda function for the database that will pull messages from a queue that is filled up automatically when the files in the file share are changed, and creating new entries when a new security group is created. This then all comes together with AWS Conformance Packs that will invoke a Lambda that will automatically change security groups that are not compliant with the ports that they have been approved.</p> <h3 id="some-more-fun-things-ive-done">Some more fun things I’ve done</h3> <p>While the AWS Security work is the Cyber Security part of the internship. There are also a variety of activities that I get the opportunity to participate in that are not related to Cyber Security. So far I have gotten the chance to participate in an internship conference where we got to hear from various speakers including century farmers, team leaders, and senior management. They had some very inspiring talks about what we can accomplish in our internship, and how we can make the most out of our time at John Deere. The other most exciting thing that I have gotten to do is actually a couple of experiences. There have been a pair of opportunities where I have gotten to go out to John Deere test facilities, and get to know more about the vehicles John Deere makes. Not only did this include getting to be up close, and talking to people who know a lot about the specifics of the combines, tractors, and sprayers John Deere makes. But I got the chance to ride in them, and see them in action. While I grew up around some farm equipment with being in a small Iowa town, and having a grandpa that farmed, it was very interesting to see what the brand new technology could do.</p> <figure class="half "> <a href="/assets/images/JohnDeere/combine.jpg"> <img src="/assets/images/JohnDeere/combine.jpg" alt="The front of a combine, with a tractor coming towards the photographer"/> </a> <a href="/assets/images/JohnDeere/sprayer-front.jpg"> <img src="/assets/images/JohnDeere/sprayer-front.jpg" alt="View facing out the front of the cab of a sprayer while driving down the road in transport mode"/> </a> <a href="/assets/images/JohnDeere/sprayer-side.jpg"> <img src="/assets/images/JohnDeere/sprayer-side.jpg" alt="View facing left of the cab of a sprayer while driving down the road in transport mode"/> </a> <a href="/assets/images/JohnDeere/inside-combine-1.jpg"> <img src="/assets/images/JohnDeere/inside-combine-1.jpg" alt="Picture from a combine cab facing down towards the harvest head"/> </a> <a href="/assets/images/JohnDeere/inside-combine-2.jpg"> <img src="/assets/images/JohnDeere/inside-combine-2.jpg" alt="Picture from a combine cab facing down towards the harvest head"/> </a> <figcaption>The pictures I took during the ride along event. </figcaption> </figure> <h3 id="some-plans-for-the-next-6-weeks">Some plans for the next 6 weeks</h3> <p>While the final 6 weeks I will be doing more work with my team. There are a few things that I will be doing that are not part of that work. I will be creating a final intern project that will be presented at the end of the summer to employees of John Deere. It is about something that I have did, and learned about over the course of the summer, and needs to be different from the other interns on my team. Right now, I have a few ideas of what I might do, but nothing concrete, but with it being a month or so away, I’m not too worried about finding something. I also have plans to job shadow a member of the Vulnerability Management team, and getting to spend time talking the members of the brand new Red Team about what their day to day holds.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="internship"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Talking about my summer internship at John Deere at halfway through]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ISU2 Cyber Defense Competition</title><link href="https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/ISU2CDC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ISU2 Cyber Defense Competition"/><published>2022-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/ISU2CDC</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://walraven.dev/blog/2022/ISU2CDC/"><![CDATA[<p>In this competition we were given a network of computers and were acting as an accounting firm’s IT department. Unfortunately this competition took place the Saturday of mid-terms, so my team did not have much time before the competition to prepare. The first time that we were able to get together as a full team was the Friday night right before the competition. In the prior weeks we knew that we would not have time to prepare thoroughly, and devised a strategy for the competition.</p> <p>Looking at the point breakdown, keeping all of the flags on the machines being worth only 20% of the overall points that could be earned. With a 50% gain back on the points lost if you can describe how the flags were taken meaning a loss of only 10% of the total points possible. If we were able to do well on the other sections like docs, and anomalies. We could lost those points and have no issues. This led us to come up with the plan of leaving all the default credentials on the machines, since that would allow red team’s automated scripts grab the flags at the competition start. After interactions in prior competitions, we were fully expecting red team to be highly upset about this and try to not give us the points for the flags. So alongside leaving default credentials we setup extremely aggressive logging that would log every command run on the system, and by who. Doing this we were able to capture the logs below showing them logging in, then in the same session planting the flags, and adding their own ssh keys to the machine.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2022-ISU2/ISU2-2022-logins.png" alt="Linux auth log showing logging in as root"/> <img src="/assets/images/2022-ISU2/ISU2-2022-commands-run.png" alt="Log showing planting flags, and adding ssh keys to the machine"/></p> <p>These logs were there to keep red team honest as we were able to find similar logs on every single one of the machines we were given. That was not the only interesting things we found though either. We were able to find red team setting UID bits to root for programs like vim, vi, less, and more. This would give them root access to the machines again if we kicked them out, and they found another non-privileged way into them. Knowing that they were actively doing this, it is something my team is planning on looking out for in the future competitions.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2022-ISU2/ISU2-2022-set-uid.png" alt="Set UID bits being changed"/></p> <p>What we did in this competition was very much not the right way of securing our systems, and preventing the red team from getting in. But the strategy we came up with was very effective. After a few hours when most flags had been taken we were in the lead up until the last 15 or so minutes when we slipped into second place. This is where we ended the competition only 17 points (or 1.7% of the total points) short of first place. I also feel like I still gained knowledge in this competition, as it helped me better understand the purpose of good logging, and made me implement it so I know how to do it in the future. It also helped me understand that it is important to know what your most vulnerable piece of software is, as that can help you greatly narrow down the search when looking for an intrusion.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="competition"/><category term="CDC"/><category term="cyber-defense"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short post about my team's "strategy" for the Cyber Defense Competition when on an extreme time crunch]]></summary></entry></feed>
